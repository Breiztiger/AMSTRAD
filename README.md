## Boot ROM

## Expansion ROM
Expansion ROM should have file extension .eXX, where XX is hex number 00-FF of ROM page to load.
Every page is 16KB. It's possible to load larger ROM. In this case every 16KB block will be loaded in subsequent pages.

* eZZ - LowROM(OS)
* eZ0 - LowROM(OS) + Page 0(Basic) + subsequent pages depending on size.

### Notes

To restore original ROM you have to reload the core (Alt-F12).
